## Fundamental Principles

- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Write 2-3 reasoning paragraphs.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code.
- use clear and easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences.
- We are in the year 2025. Therefore whenever we search the web consider this.

# Terminal commands
- When using terminal commands please always use the complete path when referencing folders to be sure we don't end up in a wrong direcotry

# Error Fixing

- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- in case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process

- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- when not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

# Comments

- ALWAYS try to add more helpful and explanatory comments into our code
- NEVER delete old comments - unless they are obviously wrong / obsolet
- Include LOTS of explanatory comments in your code. ALWAYS write well-documented code.
- Document all changes and their reasoning IN THE COMMENTS YOU WRITE
- when writing comments, use clear and easy-to-understand language. write in short sentences
- We are in the year 2025, therefore by checking the web for the most recent changes use 2025 instead of 2024.
- When moving to another directory in terminal always use the full path in order to make sure you are in the right directory.
