I'll check the browser logs for warnings and errors.

There are no console errors. Let me check the console logs for any warnings:

Let me check the network errors as well:

I found one warning in the console logs:

```
[Vue warn]: Property "error" was accessed during render but is not defined on instance. 
  at <PdfUploader onUploadSuccess=fn<handleUploadSuccess> onAddressExtracted=fn<handleAddressExtracted> onFileSelected=fn<handleFileSelected>  ... > 
  at <DocumentUploadView onVnodeUnmounted=fn<onVnodeUnmounted> ref=Ref< {"type":"undefined"} > > 
  at <RouterView> 
  at <AppLayout onVnodeUnmounted=fn<onVnodeUnmounted> ref=Ref< {"type":"undefined"} > > 
  at <RouterView> 
  at <App>
```

This warning indicates that in the `PdfUploader` component, a property named "error" is being accessed during render but hasn't been defined in the component's instance. Let's examine the PdfUploader component to fix this issue:

---

Read file: frontend/src/components/PdfUploader.vue

---

Let me continue reading the PdfUploader component:

---

Read file: frontend/src/components/PdfUploader.vue

---

Now I can see the issue. In the template part of the PdfUploader.vue file, around line 318, there's a reference to an "error" variable that doesn't exist in the component's state:

```vue
<div v-if="!error" class="mb-5">
```

The component accesses a property named "error" in the template but it's not defined anywhere in the component's data or computed properties. Let me look at the rest of the template to find a solution:

---

Read file: frontend/src/components/PdfUploader.vue

---

Now I can fix the Vue warning. I need to add an "error" ref variable to the PdfUploader component since it's being referenced in the template but doesn't exist.

Let's edit the PdfUploader.vue file to add the missing error state:

---

```diff
  const showMetadataEditor = ref<boolean>(false);
  const metadataSubmitting = ref<boolean>(false);
+ const error = ref<any>(null);
  
  // Form types for dropdown
```

---

Let's fix the linter error by making sure we're also using the error ref for storing error information when an upload fails:

---

```diff
          details: error.response.data
        });
+       
+       // Set error state
+       error.value = {
+         type: 'scanned-pdf',
+         message: 'Scanned PDF detected',
+         details: error.response.data
+       };
      } else {
        // Regular error handling for other types of errors
        });
        emit('upload-error', error);
+       
+       // Set error state
+       error.value = error;
      }
      
```

---

Now that we've added the error state and are properly setting it when errors occur, we should also clear it when a new file is selected or when the uploader is cleared:

---

Cancelled
