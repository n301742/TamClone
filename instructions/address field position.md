Address Field Position in DIN 5008
Key Dimensions:
Address Field (Anschriftfeld):
Width: 85 mm
Height: 27.3 mm
Allows for 6 lines
Additional and Remark Zone (Zusatz- und Vermerkzone):
Width: 85 mm
Height: 17.7 mm
Allows for 5 lines
Two Forms of Address Fields:
Form A ("hochgestelltes" Anschriftfeld): Briefkopf-Höhe (letterhead height) of 27 mm
Form B ("tiefgestelltes" Anschriftfeld): Briefkopf-Höhe (letterhead height) of 45 mm
Margins:
Left margin: 2.5 cm (25 mm)
Right margin: 2.0 cm (20 mm)
Horizontal Position:
While the exact horizontal position from the left or right edge isn't explicitly stated in the extracted text, we can infer from the margin information that:
The document has a left margin of 2.5 cm (25 mm)
The document has a right margin of 2.0 cm (20 mm)
The address field has a width of 85 mm
Given the standard A4 page width of 210 mm, and considering the margins, the address field would be positioned in a way that respects these measurements.
Vertical Position:
The vertical position depends on whether Form A or Form B is used:
Form A: The letterhead height is 27 mm from the top edge
Form B: The letterhead height is 45 mm from the top edge
Additional Information:
The address field consists of six lines with no line spacing between them
The additional and remark zone is positioned above the address field
In case of space constraints, the dimensions can be adjusted, and if necessary, the font size can be reduced (minimum 8 point)
For font sizes smaller than 10 point, sans-serif fonts like Arial, Calibri, or Helvetica should be used
This information should help you position the address field correctly according to the DIN 5008 standard for your address metadata extraction process.
